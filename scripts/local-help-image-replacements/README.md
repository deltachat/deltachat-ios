this directory contains
replacements for help-images from https://delta.chat/help
that do not look iOS-like.

./script/create-local-help.sh will just copy the images
from this directory to the generated offline help,
replacing the original images.

there is no need to replace every image,
just replace the images that really don't look like iOS :)
(in general, we try to have neutral images in the help)
